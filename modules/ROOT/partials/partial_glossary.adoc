[#toc-application-developers]
== application developer

Someone that develops a Starknet application. They write and deploy contracts on Starknet and Ethereum.

[#toc-blocks-previously-known-as-batches]
== blocks (previously known as batches)

Ordered sets of Starknet transactions that are run using the Starknet OS, resulting in one aggregated state change that is then committed to the Starknet L1 core contract. A block has:

* a block hash – a unique stable identifier that can be used to query and refer to the block.
* a block number – an ordinal number representing the location of the block in the sequence of accepted blocks in Starknet. Note, a block’s number may change over time. Also, a given number may refer to different blocks at different points in time, e.g., in the event of L1 chain re-orders.

[#toc-full-state-node]
== full state node

A node in the Starknet network that is used only for querying the current Starknet state. It can independently (i.e., without/o querying additional nodes) answer queries about the current state of the Starknet network, including the L1 state. It does not batch transactions or prove batches.

[#toc-prover]
== prover

A separate process (either an online service or internal to the node) that receives the output of Cairo programs and generates STARK proofs to be verified. The Prover submits the STARK proof to the verifier that registers the fact on L1.

[#toc-starknet-application]
== Starknet application

A collection of contracts (L1 and L2) that collectively implement a business flow.

[#toc-starknet-contract]
== Starknet contract

The program that encodes the implemented application business logic. This includes the application data structures and handling of specific transactions sent by users. Specifically, the Starknet contract encodes valid state transitions for the application.

* Starknet account contracts: Given account abstraction, user accounts are not implemented at the protocol level. Some contracts will, therefore, need to implement the concept of user accounts; these are called Account Contracts. The exact implementation depends on the contract; but, technically, these are Starknet contracts that are implemented in Cairo.

[#toc-starknet-l1-core-contract]
== Starknet L1 core contract

This L1 contract defines the state of the system by storing the commitment to the L2 state. The contract also stores the Starknet OS program hash – effectively defining the version of Starknet the network is running. The committed state on the L1 core contract acts as the consensus mechanism of Starknet, i.e., the system is secured by the L1 Ethereum consensus. In addition to maintaining the state, the Starknet L1 Core Contract is the main hub of operations for Starknet on L1. Specifically:

* It stores the list of allowed verifiers (contracts) that can verify state update transactions
* It facilitates L1 ↔ L2 interaction

[#toc-starknet-os]
== Starknet OS

Updates the L2 state of the system based on transactions that are received as inputs. Effectively facilitates the execution of the (Cairo-based) Starknet contracts. The OS is Cairo-based and is essentially the program whose output is proven and verified using the STARK-proof system. Specific system operations and functionality available for Starknet contracts are available as calls made to the OS.

[#toc-starknet-sequencer-node]
== Starknet sequencer node

The main node of the Starknet network. It implements the core functionality of sequencing transactions submitted to it. It executes the Starknet OS Cairo program with the relevant inputs, proves the result using the Proving Service or some internal STARK prover, and eventually updates the network state on the Starknet Core Contract.

[#toc-starknet-state]
== Starknet state

The state is composed of contracts’ code and contracts’ storage.

[#toc-starknet-transaction]
== Starknet transaction

An invocation of a specific state-transition logic that’s defined by a contract. Syntactically, a transaction has a well-defined structure that includes all the necessary metadata and an arbitrary data payload. The semantics of the transaction is defined by the invoked contract.

[#toc-starknet-users]
== Starknet users

The users that interact with Starknet sequencer nodes and, if necessary, with L1 contracts. These users, whether human or automated, are the agents that submit transactions to the Starknet network.

[#toc-blob]
== Blob

In the Cairo programming language, a "blob" refers to an undifferentiated and unstructured block of binary data. It represents a sequence of raw bytes without a predefined data type or format, commonly used for handling arbitrary and generic data in a flexible manner.

[#toc-builtins]
== Builtins

Builtins are predefined optimised low-level execution units which are added to the Cairo CPU board to perform predefined computations which are expensive to perform in vanilla Cairo (e.g., range-checks, Pedersen hash, ECDSA, …).

[#toc-cairo-step]
== Cairo step

Cairo step refers to a fundamental computational operation or instruction. It represents an elementary unit of execution within the Cairo language, typically involving mathematical, logical, or control-flow operations that collectively define the behaviour of a program.

[#toc-sierra]
== SIERRA

SIERRA is an intermediate representation introduced in Starknet development, replacing Cairo assembly with instructions in a new form called Sierra. This transition aims to ensure transaction provability while addressing issues related to reverted transactions and potential denial-of-service attacks. Sierra serves as a secure layer between user code (Cairo 1.0) and provable code (Casm), contributing to the overall security and integrity of the Starknet system.

[#toc-cairovm]
== Cairo VM

The Cairo Virtual Machine (VM) is software that knows how to take the byte-code produced by the compiler, and run it on a computer. The result of this execution is the program trace which can then be sent to a STARK prover in order to prove the validity of the instruction expressed in the Cairo code.

[#toc-stark]
== STARK

STARK is a proof system. It uses cutting-edge cryptography to provide polylogarithmic verification resources and proof size, with minimal and post-quantum-secure assumptions.

[#toc-starknet-statediff]
== State diff

The state diffs contain information on every contract whose storage was updated and additional information on contract deployments.

[#toc-account-abstraction]
== Account abstraction

Account abstraction enables more flexible account management. Rather than the protocol determining an account’s behaviour, an account contract, which is a smart contract with programmable logic, defines a user’s account.

[#toc-rpc]
== RPC

The RPC or remote procedure call is the modus operandi when performing network interactions, in turn allowing you to execute subroutines or procedures as they are also known, with little worry about putting the details of your remote interactions explicitly in code.

[#toc-api]
== API

The Provider API allows you to interact with the Starknet network, without signing transactions or messages.

[#toc-starknet-component]
== Component

A component closely resembles a contract and encompasses storage variables, events, as well as external and internal functions. Unlike a standalone contract, a component cannot be deployed independently; instead, its code becomes integrated into the contract to which it is attached.

[#toc-starknet-array]
== Array

An array is a collection of elements of the same type. You can create and use array methods by using the ArrayTrait trait from the core library.

[#toc-starknet-signer]
== Signer

The Signer is a smart contract with a private key for signing transactions, while the Account Descriptor is a JSON file detailing the wallet’s address and public key.

[#toc-multicall]
== Multicall

Multi-call executes multiple calls as a single transaction. If one call fails, the entire operation is aborted. Use it to prevent leaving your system in an inconsistent state.

[#toc-import]
== Import

In Cairo, as is the case with other programming languages, it’s undesirable and impractical to keep an entire program in one source file. To avoid this, and to facilitate modularity, Cairo allows importing a module from another file.
